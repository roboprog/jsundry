DEAD PROJECT!

Was doodling with this in 2011.  Angular 1.0 came out in 2012.  Nuff said.

The JSundry project is a demo for the technique of using a stub
page plus Ajax and template HTML files to assemble working pages
together from sundry sources in a way that supports caching
and makes javascript injection harder.

JSundry is licensed under the LGPL license. (see lgpl.txt)

See js/jsundry.js for the actual JavaScript code.

TODO: API documentation.
